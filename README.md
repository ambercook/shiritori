# shiritori

[Shiritori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiritori) is a Japanese word game that I think has great potential for increasing exposure to and learning Japanese vocabulary. It's been recreated online before but has never been decked out with features I wish existed, so I'm going to try and create one and use it as a means to play around with React and Webpack. Stay tuned and let me know if you have suggestions on improvement.
